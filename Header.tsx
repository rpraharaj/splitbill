// This file (Header.tsx at the project root) is intentionally left empty.
// Its previous content appeared to be an outdated or misplaced copy
// of 'components/Header.tsx' and had incorrect import paths
// (e.g., '../types' from the root directory) which can lead to
// critical module loading errors.

// The primary Header component for this application is located at:
// './components/Header.tsx'
// and is imported directly by 'App.tsx'.

// This file can likely be safely deleted from your project.
